\section{Private-Key Encryption}
\subsection*{Computational Security}
Two relaxations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Security is only guaranteed against \emph{efficient} 
    adversaries that run for some feasible amount of time
    \item Adversaries can potentially succeed
     with some \emph{very small probability}
\end{enumerate}

A scheme is $(t,\varepsilon)-secure$ if any adversary running for time at most
 $t$ succeeds in breaking the scheme with probability at most $\varepsilon$.\\
